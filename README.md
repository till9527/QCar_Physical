This is the repository for my physical Qcar code. This is being run on a Quanser QCar 1.


Some important things to know:


IPs may change frequently. Refer to Quanser documentation on how to figure out the IPs of traffic lights.


For deploying the code, use winscp to connect to the qcar, and then a sudo python command for running it (additionally refer to Quanser documentation)
