This is the repository for my physical Qcar code. This is being run on a Quanser QCar 1.


Some important things to know:


IPs may change frequently. Refer to Quanser documentation on how to figure out the IPs of traffic lights.


I do not have any models included on here, and the default route to them refers to somewhere on my PC. This will need to change depending on where your YOLOv8 model is.


For deploying the code, use winscp to connect to the qcar, and then a sudo python command for running it (additionally refer to Quanser documentation)
